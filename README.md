# OMNI AGENT STACK GOD-TIER (2025)

**The definitive, production-ready, self-evolving framework for building and deploying autonomous AI agent systems.**

This is not just a template; it's a fully operational, high-performance ecosystem designed for scale, resilience, and continuous evolution. It embodies the most advanced DevOps and architectural patterns of 2025, ready for immediate deployment.

## üöÄ Core Philosophy

- **Zero-Touch Operations**: The system is designed to be self-healing and self-managing. Manual intervention is the exception, not the rule.
- **Radical Scalability**: From a single node to a global cluster, the architecture scales horizontally and vertically with near-linear performance gains.
- **Continuous Evolution**: Agents and infrastructure learn and adapt. The system is designed to improve itself over time through integrated feedback loops and AI-driven orchestration.
- **Fortress-Grade Security**: A zero-trust network is enforced at every layer. Security is not an afterthought; it's the foundation.

## üèõÔ∏è God-Tier Architecture Overview

![Architecture Diagram](https://placeholder.com/image.png) <!-- Placeholder for a future generated diagram -->

The stack is composed of several loosely coupled, highly cohesive services communicating over a secure internal network.

1.  **Caddy (Reverse Proxy & Zero-Trust Gateway)**: The single entry point to the system. It handles automatic HTTPS, load balancing, and enforces zero-trust policies.
2.  **API Gateway (Go)**: The primary interface for all external communication. It authenticates, routes, and rate-limits requests to the appropriate backend services.
3.  **Orchestrator (Go)**: The brain of the system. It manages agent lifecycles, schedules tasks, and coordinates complex workflows between agents. It's the core of the self-healing and auto-evolution capabilities.
4.  **Agent Services (Go Templates)**: Lightweight, containerized, and dynamically scalable agent instances. Built from a hardened template, they can be specialized for any task.
5.  **WebUI (SvelteKit)**: A real-time, reactive dashboard for monitoring, managing, and interacting with the agent ecosystem.
6.  **PostgreSQL (Primary Datastore)**: The source of truth for persistent data, agent states, and configurations.
7.  **Redis (Cache & Message Broker)**: Used for high-speed caching, real-time messaging, and managing distributed locks.
8.  **Monitoring Stack (Prometheus, Grafana, Loki)**: Provides deep, real-time insights into system health, performance, and logs. Dashboards are pre-configured for immediate use.
9.  **Visual Agent (Playwright)**: A specialized agent that can interact with web pages, take screenshots, and solve visual challenges like captchas. It runs as a dedicated service, ready to be controlled by the Orchestrator.

## ü§´ Secret Techniques & 2025 Best Practices

This stack incorporates advanced techniques that are becoming standard in 2025 for high-performance systems.

| Layer | Technique | Rationale & Impact |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Networking** | **Caddy as a Zero-Trust PEP** | Instead of a simple Nginx proxy, Caddy acts as a Policy Enforcement Point. It terminates TLS and re-establishes it internally, ensuring all traffic is authenticated and authorized, even between services. This prevents lateral movement attacks. |
| **Orchestration** | **AI-Driven Predictive Scaling** | The Orchestrator uses Prometheus metrics to predict load spikes and proactively scales agent instances *before* they are needed, eliminating cold-start latency and ensuring consistent performance. |
| **Database** | **Hyper-Tuned PostgreSQL** | The PostgreSQL instance is configured with `pg_partman` for automatic time-based partitioning of large tables (e.g., logs, events), ensuring queries remain fast regardless of data volume. |
| **Concurrency** | **Structured Concurrency in Go** | All Go services utilize structured concurrency patterns with `context` propagation and error groups. This makes the system incredibly robust, preventing goroutine leaks and ensuring graceful shutdowns. |
| **Frontend** | **Edge-First Rendering with SvelteKit** | The WebUI is not a monolithic SPA. It leverages SvelteKit's adaptive rendering to serve static content from the edge, stream dynamic data, and only run client-side JS when absolutely necessary, resulting in near-instant load times. |
| **Logging** | **Correlation IDs Everywhere** | Every request that enters the API Gateway is assigned a unique `X-Correlation-ID`. This ID is propagated through every service, log, and trace, allowing for one-click tracing of an entire transaction across the distributed system in Grafana/Loki. |
| **Self-Healing** | **Dynamic Health Probes** | Health checks aren't static. The Orchestrator can dynamically adjust the health check parameters of agent services based on their current task, allowing for more aggressive recovery for critical tasks and more lenient checks for long-running jobs. |
| **Security** | **Centralized Secret Management** | All API keys (LLMs, Telegram, etc.) and credentials are managed via the `.env` file for local development. In production, these should be injected via a secure secret management system (e.g., Docker Secrets, HashiCorp Vault, or cloud provider's secret manager). |
| **Vision** | **Headless Browser as a Service** | The Visual Agent runs Playwright as a persistent, containerized service. This allows any other agent in the stack to request browser automation tasks (e.g., "log into this site and get the data") without needing a browser locally. |

## üõ†Ô∏è Getting Started

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <repo_url>
    cd omni-agent-stack
    ```

2.  **Create your environment file:**
    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    ```
    *Modify `.env` with your own secure credentials.*

3.  **Build and run the stack:**
    ```bash
    make up
    ```
    *This will build all services and start them in detached mode.*

4.  **Access the services:**
    - **WebUI**: `https://localhost` (or your domain)
    - **Grafana**: `https://localhost/grafana`
    - **API Docs**: `https://localhost/api/docs`

## Makefile Commands

- `make up`: Build and start all services.
- `make down`: Stop and remove all services.
- `make logs`: Tail the logs of all services.
- `make ps`: Show the status of all running containers.
- `make prune`: Remove all stopped containers, networks, and dangling images.
